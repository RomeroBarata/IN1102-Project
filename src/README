==PREPARATION==
    Before running the 'mvfcmv' program, make sure to generate the
dissimilarity matrices by using 'gen_diss_mtx.R' located under the
'R' directory of this project. Once you have done this, compile 
'mvfcmv' and execute the program passing 'mfeat.par' as parameter.

    On windows, it is possible to drag and drop 'mfeat.par' into the
'mvfcmv.exe' in order to run the program without the need of a CLI.
